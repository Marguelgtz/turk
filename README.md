An Animusic-inspired machine that plays classical music with ball bearings, sort of, and shows a summary of the notes played.

Inspired by the Animusic video "Pipe Dream" ([watch it on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyCIpKAIFyo)) and [Euphony](https://github.com/qiao/euphony) by [Xueqiao Xu](https://github.com/qiao).
Built atop the [Musical Turk](http://ulysse.io/turk) framework by [Ulysse Carion](http://ulysse.io).

Made with help from:

* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)
* [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js)
* [jasmid](https://github.com/gasman/jasmid)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)

and a lot of the code and _all_ of the pieces are from [Euphony](https://github.com/qiao/euphony).

The PipeGeometry is an update of the [TubeGeometry code](https://github.com/Troilk/cs291-contest) by [Vitalii Maslikov](https://github.com/Troilk).

Because it requires high-precision MIDI playing, this demo is usually best with Chrome. Even then, you may get hesitations. When you change music, you may also need to hit "reload."
